That being the case, the GoGet.My platform allows for posters and GoGetters to switch roles from time to time during the fulfillment of a task or tasks.
          p The services as mentioned above shall collectively be defined as the "services". These terms and conditions shall govern your use of and participation as poster or GoGetter in the GoGet.My platform.
